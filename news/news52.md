As our development gets another boost, thanks in part to funding from CEO Thomas Edwardson's sale of a percentage of his holding company, our attention turns to the next round to establish key investment verticals.

This round is unique; a split into discrete sections, allowing investors to either join through the business or target areas that they may be considering.

Chief exec Edwardson has pledged funding to complete the platform’s full development. Applications for regulation and initial marketing are in process. All these areas are currently hitting their milestones, allowing a low-risk opportunity for new investors.

Attention is now on seeding the investment verticals, all of which are designed to simplify the purchase of real-world assets and hold them through the monetization process. In the past, such investors would have had to set up, develop, and cover personnel costs, creating uncertainty in terms of returns. No more of that pressure in this broader, more practical business model.

The company is in an advanced position with fund allocation in this round. The anticipated returns on N51 verticals have put a valuation of $5m on the platform – and we’re looking to raise up to $1m at this valuation. It’s an exciting time for the company, and an opportunity to prove the verticals concept. In time, this will be integrated with the platform as we scale for the mass market. Time for forward-thinkers to come in alongside the founders and early investors – and benefit from the first wave of value creation. Then you can sit back and wait to see some disruptive returns.

Away from this core raise, each investment vertical will be heading into a seeding round. They will be directly accessible; each vertical will be looking to raise $200,000 to establish the strategy. Early investors can expect some high growth from the strategy, as well as the platform launch.
