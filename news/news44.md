## Overview

The N51 Platform is maintaining a core focus as we prepare for our imminent launch in Singapore — and that’s to bridge the gap between DeFi and TradFi.

## Bridging the Gap

The support structure, to stick with the bridge metaphor, is to embrace all regulations and technologies designed to safeguard our clients — without losing our spirit of innovation. Our investment partners want sustainable returns via real-world assets. Criteria such as well-managed risks, high returns, and liquidity make perfect sense. The N51 Platform neatly pulls those vital threads together.

It sounds simple enough, but N51 doesn’t believe in doing things by halves. “We’re disrupting investment in real-world assets in sectors such as venture capital, technology metals, finance, and Bitcoin mining,” explains CEO Thomas Edwardson. “The platform has unique benefits for classic and digital investors. We’ve been comfortably overtaking the competition by riding the wave of the digital transition.”

### Investment Benefits

> “More classically inclined investors demand the straightforward comfort of equity investing — but with the aid of today's technology, including AI, their user experience can be brought to the fore, and provide unprecedented transparency.”

> “We’re keeping a close eye on market developments and attracting investors from various levels,”

> “As the launch date approaches, we’re bearing crucial factors in mind.”

Digital investors stand to benefit from increased visibility, governance, and interaction thanks to the democratising effects of tokenization. N51’s security tokens embrace blockchain technology to deliver practical and promising DeFi investments, with direct access to the N51 Marketplace — and the innate security of the distributed ledger system.

Classical investors get a boost in portfolio visibility, help with governance, and increased interaction. Their peace-of-mind comes from our reputation — and the fact that the underlying investment vehicle performs with strict adherence to all Singapore regulations.
