## Overview

Seek and ye shall find… N51’s constant vigilance in the search for globally trusted entities with whom to do business works both ways, and we’re proud to have attracted the attention of the Madrid-based World Network Group SL.

## New Partnership

Group owner Conan Doyle and his associate Bruce Drezner, who recently met with our chief executive Thomas Edwardson in Spain, have approved N51 as one of the group’s fund recipients – based on the promise of the platform and the underlying launch verticals.

> “This is a great new relationship for N51,”  
> “We have a lot of experience, and a lot of trusted investors worldwide. Conan and Bruce are as excited as we are about the platform and the verticals, especially lithium. The extraction site is in Spain, so it’s all coming together nicely,”

The added impetus from the World Network Group will help to power N51 target into the next round of funding.
