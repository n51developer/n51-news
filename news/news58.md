N51 has found the perfect technology infrastructure-provider in Google. CEO Thomas Edwardson and his tech team are excited to be engaging with Google - and we're mid-flow, integrating the wisdom the tech giant has to offer.

Our current arrangement is a facility of up to $200,000, allowing the team to develop without fretting about costs. The company is set to apply for further Google funding for the integration of AI as a tool within the investment platform. More news on this soon.
