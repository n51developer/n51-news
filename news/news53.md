N51 – always on the move – is looking for key investors to align with the founders’ vision, invest in the platform, and support those verticals. The people we’re hoping to involve will have an early-access opportunity, and doubtless have appetizing returns and benefits on their radar.

With a strict eye on regulation, we’re committed to attracting up to 50 investors into each vertical. They’ll sit alongside the platform founders – and ride the wave as new members join and the business scales. Early birds entering the platform will have their investment held via equity or tokens (their preference, of course). Those first-in will qualify for “influencer-user” status – and have more rights than the laggards.

We’re building the future of finance; interested? Please form an orderly queue…
